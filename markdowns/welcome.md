# Getting Started With Go!
Welcome to this tutorial on how to get started with Go. Go is a very popular application level programming language developed by Google, that have been used in all major projects in the modern Programming world. Projects like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [hugo](http://gohugo.io/), all leverage the power and simplicity of Go to build scalabe platforms. 

It makes sense for a new programmer today to invest in learning Go and how it leverages the technologies.

Why should I learn Go?
===
* **It's really easy to learn**: Golang favours simplicity, both in terms of systax structures and programming conventions. Everything in the Go programming environment has beed designed to minimize friction and make the experience smooth and pleasant. That is no more long compilation times, no more dubious compiler errors and no more strange things.
* **It's fast and reliable**: Go is a compiled programming language with buildin concurrency mechanisms that make it easy to  write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines. It has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection.
* **It has a vast exosystems**: Go has a huge ecosystem. More that [756881](http://go-search.org/) packages and counting! It spans the whole range of applications and its a good source of code reading.
* **It has created a lot of demand for good Golang Engineers**: The more code is deployed to production the more need there is for solid Golang Developers. This is just a quick tutorial of Go to get you started.

What we will do in this tutorial:
===
* Explore the bacics of Go.
* Learn more about Goroutines and why are so awesome.
* Get more resources to continue learning and working with Go.
